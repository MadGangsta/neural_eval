# NeuroEvoComputing-lab
Educational implementation of neuroevolutionary NCL(negative correlation learning)-algorithm for training ensamble neural network.
Project was made within course of Neuroevolutionary Computing in Tomsk Polytechnic University.
</br>

### Used packages
---
- matplotlib, 
- numpy
- sklearn
### Features
---
- Training ensamble neural network using NCL-algorithm.
- Visualisation of training results (metrics, model architecture, best model so far and etc.)
</br>

### Negotive correlation learning
---
A method related to training an ensemble of ANNs in such a way that their outputs correlate as little as possible.
Used algorithm can be found in [this paper](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pxt/NC/ncl.pdf).
</br>

### Set up
---
1. Install required packages.
2. Run NCL.py file.
